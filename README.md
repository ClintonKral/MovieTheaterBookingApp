A C++ application that simulates booking a movie ticket through an SQL database with multiple tables connected representing the overall movie theater. 

Uses MySQL Database connection that requires logging in to local instance for users to try this on their own server.

Database structure ERD is seen here as the initial draft. Some may not be in use right now, but this is how organization goes with trying to populate primary and foreign keys to have a better understanding how it all communicates.
